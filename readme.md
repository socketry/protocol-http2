# Protocol::HTTP2

Provides a low-level implementation of the HTTP/2 protocol.

[![Development Status](https://github.com/socketry/protocol-http2/workflows/Test/badge.svg)](https://github.com/socketry/protocol-http2/actions?workflow=Test)

## Usage

Please see the [project documentation](https://socketry.github.io/protocol-http2/) for more details.

  - [Getting Started](https://socketry.github.io/protocol-http2/guides/getting-started/index) - This guide explains how to use the `protocol-http2` gem to implement a basic HTTP/2 client.

## Releases

Please see the [project releases](https://socketry.github.io/protocol-http2/releases/index) for all releases.

### v0.23.0

  - Introduce a limit to the number of CONTINUATION frames that can be read to prevent resource exhaustion. The default limit is 8 continuation frames, which means a total of 9 frames (1 initial + 8 continuation). This limit can be adjusted by passing a different value to the `limit` parameter in the `Continued.read` method. Setting the limit to 0 will only read the initial frame without any continuation frames. In order to change the default, you can redefine the `LIMIT` constant in the `Protocol::HTTP2::Continued` module, OR you can pass a different frame class to the framer.

### v0.22.1

  - Improved tracing performance by only tracing framer operations when in an active trace context.
  - Updated `protocol-http` dependency version in gemspec.
  - Code modernization and documentation improvements.

### v0.22.0

  - [Added Priority Update Frame and Stream Priority](https://socketry.github.io/protocol-http2/releases/index#added-priority-update-frame-and-stream-priority)

### v0.21.0

  - **Breaking**: Removed support for priority frame and stream dependencies. The `Protocol::HTTP2::Stream` class no longer tracks dependencies, and `Stream#send_headers` no longer takes `priority` as the first argument. This change simplifies the internal implementation significantly as HTTP/2 priority frames have been deprecated in the protocol specification.

### v0.20.0

  - Improved performance of dependency management by avoiding linear search operations.
  - Removed `traces` as a required dependency - it's now optional and only used when explicitly needed.
  - Added better documentation for `maximum_concurrent_streams` setting.
  - Restored 100% test coverage and exposed trace provider for optional tracing support.

### v0.19.4

  - Reduced the number of window update frames sent to improve network efficiency.

### v0.19.3

  - Improved window update frame handling and performance optimizations.
  - Better implementation of `Window#inspect` for debugging.

### v0.19.2

  - Added traces to framer for better debugging and monitoring capabilities.
  - Minor fixes to logging output.

### v0.19.1

  - Performance improvements for synchronized output handling.
  - Extracted `window.rb` into separate module for better organization.

### v0.19.0

  - Removed unused `opened` hook that was never utilized.
  - Improved ASCII art diagram in documentation.
  - Modernized gem structure and dependencies.
  - Moved test fixtures into proper namespace organization.
